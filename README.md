# Shudrum filter

> A filter designed to provide a tailored experience for every stage of the late

[Roadmap](#roadmap) bellow!

# Objective

Long story short, the three main keypoints for those filters are :

- Having a more "verbose" mini map displaying items on ground.
- Having a per area level tailored filter.
- Having a theme driven look'n'feel.

Never miss anything on the ground—find items at a glance with these filters. Some
might say it’s a bit too verbose, but I prefer being able to spot Rares, Waystones,
or other items without running around everywhere.

Since this filter is managed via a script, it allows for dynamic configurations
based on your current map level. For example, you’ll always know if a dropped
map is below or above your current tier, no matter what level you’re on.

Theming is a key focus for this filter. I aim to keep a strong and visually
appealing color scheme for events and alerts, while respecting the game’s
established color code.

There is currently two modes: Standard and Expert. I aim to add an intermediate
one to allow advanced players to filter out more and more items they do not
want.

Do not hesitate to [contribute](#how-to-contribute), bring ideas on the
[Issues](https://github.com/Shudrum/poe2-shudrum-filter/issues) section and help
on the configuration tweaking of this filter.

## Motivation

There are many great filters out there, but I always wanted something more
flexible—a filter that adapts to the level I’m at in the game. I also wanted
event-based color schemes and a less aggressive display, while still keeping
important items easy to spot.

Doing this by hand is a real hassle, so I decided to create a generator script.
It lets me—and maybe the community too—manage filters using code. For example,
it’s now possible to have a different map filter for every map level!

These scripts might even allow for automated updates in the future, with help
from some APIs.

I’m not the best PoE player, but I hope this filter will resonate with others.
I’ll do my best to keep it updated. And with the release of Path of Exile 2 EA,
now seems like the perfect time to share it with the community!

## How to install

Clic on the filter you want to install behind, then save it on your Path of Exile
2 folder:

```
%userprofile%\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile 2
```

- [Standard filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shudrum/poe2-shudrum-filter/refs/heads/master/ShudrumFilterStandard.filter)
- **[Intermediate filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shudrum/poe2-shudrum-filter/refs/heads/master/ShudrumFilterIntermediate.filter)**
- [Expert filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shudrum/poe2-shudrum-filter/refs/heads/master/ShudrumFilterExpert.filter)

Then, in game: Escape -> Options -> Game -> Filters -> Select the filter from
the dropdown box.
