# Shudrum Filter
# ==============
#
# A filter designed to provide a tailored experience for every stage of the late game.
#
# Objective
# ---------
#
# Long story short, the three main keypoints for those filters are :
# - Having a more "verbose" mini map displaying items on ground.
# - Having a per area level tailored filter.
# - Having a theme driven look'n'feel.
#
# Never miss anything on the ground—find items at a glance with these filters. Some
# might say it’s a bit too verbose, but I prefer being able to spot Rares, Waystones,
# or other items without running around everywhere.
#
# Since this filter is managed via a script, it allows for dynamic configurations
# based on your current map level. For example, you’ll always know if a dropped
# map is below or above your current tier, no matter what level you’re on.
#
# Theming is a key focus for this filter. I aim to keep a strong and visually
# appealing color scheme for events and alerts, while respecting the game’s
# established color code.
#
# There is currently two modes: Standard and Expert. I aim to add an intermediate
# one to allow advanced players to filter out more and more items they do not
# want.
#
# Do not hesitate to contribute, bring ideas on the issues section and help
# on the configuration tweaking of this filter.
#
# Motivation
# ----------
#
# There are many great filters out there, but I always wanted something more
# flexible—a filter that adapts to the level I’m at in the game. I also wanted
# event-based color schemes and a less aggressive display, while still keeping
# important items easy to spot.
#
# Doing this by hand is a real hassle, so I decided to create a generator script.
# It lets me—and maybe the community too—manage filters using code. For example,
# it’s now possible to have a different map filter for every map level!
#
# These scripts might even allow for automated updates in the future, with help
# from some APIs.
#
# I’m not the best PoE player, but I hope this filter will resonate with others.
# I’ll do my best to keep it updated. And with the release of Path of Exile 2 EA,
# now seems like the perfect time to share it with the community!
#
# Features
# --------
#
# - Generates two levels of filters: Standard and Expert.
# - The more gold is stacked, the larger the label becomes.
# - The Waystone filter adapts dynamically to the current area level.
# - The map displays more objects, even with small dots, making them easier to find.
# - The filter is currently in "DEBUG" mode. If you see an item with a garish red,
#   green, and blue label, it means it is not yet "filtered."
